so basically the elements have their own responsiveness.so first hack is dont give height and width to the components .
if suppose you want to give height and width if it is compuslory use percentage for it
the percentage for child div is always to parent measurement means .suppose if a parent is given 80% then child given 50% means it is 40% of its parent
