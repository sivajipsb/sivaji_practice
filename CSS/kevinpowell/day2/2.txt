Takeaway:
		For font-sizes, always use "rem" to avoid compounding problem
		Use "em" for properties other than fontSize like margin, padding, width etc...
		rem are useful when we are trying to use media queries

Just some example CSS to show how rem will work, notice the root font-size is set using px via html tag

html, body { font-size: 16px; }
div { font-size: 18px; }
p { font-size: 1rem; }
And the corresponding HTML:

<div>
  <p>Lorem Ipsum</p>
</div>
Because the <p> tag is set to 1rem it ignores the parent div’s font-size of 18px. 
however, if we instead set the font-size to 1em, the paragraph would inherit the 18px font-size 
of its parent element. I know this example isn’t particularly useful, but hopefully it can help
 illustrate the difference between em and rem.

In em relative unit the font size is measured on the base of nearest parent font size but if the font size is not defined for any of parent elements then by default font size will be defined according to the root html element

The rem relative unit is calculated only by root html element, thus, the font size of the parent element does not affect it
